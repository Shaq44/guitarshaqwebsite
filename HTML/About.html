        Shaquan grew up in the Bay Area playing sports. Music wasn't much of a thought growing up.
        Later in life he wasn't sure what he wanted to do during college so he started off as a communications major but after a while decided to get into music.
        His biggest earliest influence on guitar was Jimi Hendrix. He dove head first into many Hendrix songs, which cemented his passion for music.
        He attended a community college where he continued to study music in an academic setting. His interest in Jazz started to grow and continued his studies at the 
        University of Southern Mississippi.There he became part of an amazing music community where he was introduced to other genres and started his path as a musician.
        His other influences in guitar are Eddie Hazel, Wes Montegomery, Jimmy Herring, and Scott Henderson. He continues his path as a musician teaching and playing live music.
